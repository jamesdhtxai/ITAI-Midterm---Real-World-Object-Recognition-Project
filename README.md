# Real-World Object Recognition Project

## Objective

Our group is applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to develop a model for recognizing objects in real-world images. This project is a collaboration using Google Colab or Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

## Dataset Selection

### Options

- CIFAR-10
- CIFAR-100
- A subset of ImageNet
- A custom dataset (subject to instructor approval)

### Custom Dataset Guidelines

- **Minimum Size**: A few hundred images per class are recommended (100 to 200).
- **Preprocessing Requirements**: Images should be high resolution, consistently labeled, and preprocessed to match the input specifications of the chosen pre-trained model.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

- **Dataset Preparation**: Choose your dataset carefully. For custom datasets, ensure the images are diverse, high-quality, and accurately labeled.
- **Processing Steps**: Implement normalization, resizing, and augmentation. Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Step 2: Model Architecture

- Start with a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet) as your base.
- Adjust the architecture to suit your dataset, explaining your modifications.

### Step 3: Training and Validation

- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on your chosen dataset.
- Use strategies to improve training outcomes and prevent overfitting.
- Monitor performance through validation metrics.

### Step 4: Evaluation and Testing

- Evaluate your model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Discuss the model's performance, noting any limitations or discrepancies from expected outcomes.

### Step 5: Discussion and Conclusion

- Reflect on any challenges faced during the project and the solutions implemented.
- Suggest potential improvements or future directions for research.
- Summarize the project's significance and your key learnings.

## Deliverables

- **Comprehensive Technical Report**: Documenting your methodology, findings, and conclusions.
- **Code Repository**: Well-documented source code, preferably hosted on GitHub.
- **Group Presentation (10 minutes)**: Presenting your findings, methodologies, and model performance.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to the project requirements.
- Effective use and understanding of CNNs and transfer learning.
- Innovation in model optimization and problem-solving.
- Teamwork quality, including balanced contributions.
- Clarity and thoroughness of the presentation and report.
